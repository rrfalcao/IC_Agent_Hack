# Next.js Adapter Base Layer

This adapter scaffolds a full-stack Next.js agent shell with:

- App Router layout and API routes under `app/api/agent/*`
- Reown AppKit wallet modal wired to Wagmi + Solana adapters
- Dashboard UI for invoking entrypoints, inspecting manifests, and monitoring health
- `x402-next` middleware for paywalled invoke/stream routes
- Session token API (`/api/x402/session-token`) for optional Coinbase Onramp flows

## Optional Coinbase Onramp

Set `CDP_API_KEY_ID`/`CDP_API_KEY_SECRET` and call the provided `/api/x402/session-token` route to surface the "Get more USDC" button inside the paywall.
