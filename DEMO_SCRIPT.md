---

### 💬 AI CHAT - ChainGPT Integration (1:15 - 1:50)

**DO:** Click "💬 Chat" in navigation

**SAY:**
> "Let's start with the **ChainGPT Web3 LLM** — Bounty 2 requires this. I'll ask a blockchain question."

**DO:** Type: `What is the difference between ERC-20 and BEP-20 tokens?`

**SAY:**
> "Notice the **streaming response** — real-time token delivery, not a slow blob. This is running through ChainGPT's API."

*[Wait for score to appear]*

> "The AI found issues — maybe the score is 65%. Below our 80% threshold."

*[New iteration appears]*

> "**Iteration 2**: It's automatically regenerating, addressing those vulnerabilities..."

*[Wait for better score]*

> "Now we're at 85% — **above threshold**. The audit loop is complete."

**DO:** Click the iteration dots to show comparison

> "You can actually compare each version — see exactly what the AI fixed. Full transparency."

---

#### 📋 TRANSACTION PREVIEW (Security Feature)

*[TransactionPreview modal appears]*

**SAY:**

## 🎯 Key Talking Points to Emphasize

### Unique Differentiators (repeat these)
1. **"Self-correcting audit loop"** — AI improves its own code
2. **"Gasless for users"** — Facilitator pays all fees
3. **"On-chain identity"** — Not just an AI, a verifiable agent
4. **"Production-ready"** — Deployed, not localhost

### Power Phrases
- "From natural language to deployed contract"
- "Full transparency before any action"
- "One-click everything"
- "No gas worries, ever"

### Technical Terms to Drop
- EIP-712 structured signing
- ERC-8004 agent NFT
- x402 HTTP payment protocol
- ChainGPT SDK integration
- Self-correcting AI loop

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### If the app is slow:
> "The AI is processing — this is real computation, not mocked responses."

### If MetaMask is slow:
> "Waiting for the network... BNB Testnet can have variable latency."

### If audit score is already high (no loop):
> "Perfect! The AI nailed it on the first try — but the loop is ready if needed."

### If something fails:
> "Let me show you the error handling — even errors are user-friendly."
